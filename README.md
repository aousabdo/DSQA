# Data Science Q&A and Imputation Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive Data Science Q&A document and an R script for data imputation analysis.

## Contents

1. **DS_QA.md**: A markdown file containing a series of data science interview questions and detailed answers. This document covers a wide range of topics relevant to data science in military and government contexts.

2. **imputation.R**: An R script that performs a comprehensive analysis of missing data and applies various imputation techniques.

3. **index.html**: An HTML rendering of the Data Science Q&A document.

## Data Science Q&A

The DS_QA.md file contains a series of interview questions and answers covering topics such as:

- Predictive maintenance for military aircraft
- Handling sensitive data in secure environments
- Experience with cloud platforms for military applications
- Version control and collaborative coding practices
- Geospatial data analysis
- And many more...

This document serves as a valuable resource for data scientists working in or preparing for roles in military and government sectors.

## Imputation Analysis Script

The imputation.R script performs a comprehensive analysis of missing data and applies various imputation techniques. Key features include:

- Data exploration and visualization of missing patterns
- Simple imputation methods (mean, mode)
- Multiple imputation using MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)
- Visualization of imputed data
- Imputation quality evaluation
- Sensitivity analysis comparing different imputation methods

To run the script, ensure you have R installed along with the required packages listed at the beginning of the script.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aousabdo/DSQA.git
   ```

2. To view the Data Science Q&A:
   - Open `DS_QA.md` in a markdown viewer or
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser

3. To run the imputation analysis:
   - Open R or RStudio
